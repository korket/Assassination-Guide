                    <p>Assassin is a damage dealer class that is focused on casting skills from melee to mid range.
                        She is excellent at dealing both AoE and single target damage. With her, you don’t have to worry
                        about getting aggroed since she has a unique skill called Dark Shroud, which allows her to be
                        invisible all the time. Her playstyle involves short combo rotations.

                        <a>Since this skill has 3 seconds cooldown, it would take you too long to get max stacks.</a>
                        <a>That's why we have to combine it with [T]. Using [T] allows you to deal 6 [Q]s in a single moment.</a>

                        <a>Other than using it for the initial combo to build up stacks, you should use this skill to deal extra damage when all of the other skills are on cooldown. But be careful of unwanted [T] reset.</a>
                        <a>This skill also resets the cooldown of [W] when you reach max stacks.</a>

                    <!-- ability W -->

                    <div class="ability-w ability">
                        <a>Since this skill gives you an extra 25% of attack damage after usage, you should always use [W] first before doing your big damage combo, because most of your skill scales with attack damage.</a>

                        <a>Even though the damage may look small, if you combine it with [T], it will deal huge damage.</a>
                        <video class="ability-explanation-video" src="./abilities/explanations/W/W2.mp4" autoplay muted loop></video>
                        <a>This skill is usually used first as an opening for gap closer between bosses, but when you are in melee range, use [Q] first before [W], since it resets [Q] after usage.</a>

                        <a>This is another damage-dealing skill you use; usually you use it at the end of your combo rotations.</a>
                        <a>Before you use this, make sure you still have [W] buff to have the extra attack damage bonus, and you are behind the enemy boss to get 50% extra damage.</a>
                        <a>You can also use this skill in an emergency, when you are in a tight position and want to evade boss skills since it gives you a temporary movement speed bonus.</a>

                        <a>Another way of getting [Q] stacks to max. In the rotations later, we will use this skill to get another [T] refresh, so that in a single rotation, you can cast [T] three times.</a>
